TEST PLAN — DB-backed page-types

1) Open /admin/types: existing mappings should display (if previously saved).
2) Add a new mapping; refresh page — it should persist and render (not empty).
3) Run a batch with mixed-case page_type labels; secondaries from the mapping should appear in JSON-LD.
4) Delete a mapping; confirm it disappears after refresh and batches reflect the change.
