Commit: fix: enforce primary @type and broaden schema support

- normalize.py: force root node '@type' to the configured primary type
  (prevents custom labels like "Medical Specialty Page" from leaking)
- schemas.py: add minimal schemas for MedicalService and MedicalSpecialty
  so choosing them as primary won't fall back to MedicalOrganization
